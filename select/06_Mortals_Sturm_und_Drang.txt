Came to us when darkness had fallen
Took us up from where we were crawli'n
Said that we would find what we thought for
But now where trapped in endless war

Promises were made out of lies
Anguish fear and dread in our minds

Mortals
But you'll never take our souls away
We are Mortals
But you'll never take our hearts away

Thought that we were free still we were slaves
Sanity was lost into madness
Blinded by the promise of our hopes
We couldn't see that hell is what we chose

Destruction you have brought before our eyes
Will ove day be upon your kind

Promises were made out of lies
Anguish fear and dread in our minds
Destruction you have brought before our eyes
Will one day be upon your kind
