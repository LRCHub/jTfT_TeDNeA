Today
Today I learned
Today I learned something
But what I learned it got under my skin
But I
But I don't care
Today
Today I learned
Today I learned something
And what I learned it got under my skin
But I
But I don't care
Today, today, today I learned something
And what I learned it got under my skin
But I but I but I but I
But I don't care, but I don't care
Today, today, today, today
Today I learned something, today I learned something
And what I learned and what I learned
It got under my skin, it got under my skin
But I but I but I but I
But I don't care, but I don't care
Apparently it's all a dream
And when we die it starts again
Apparently it's all a dream
And when we die it starts again
Mortals, mortals, mortals, mortals
Apparently it's all a dream
And when we die it starts again
Apparently it's all a dream
And when we die it starts again
Mortals, mortals, mortals, mortals
But the life is burning in my bones
And the pain is tickling my soul
But the life is burning in my bones
And the pain is tickling my soul
But the life is burning in my bones
And the pain is tickling my soul
But the life is burning in my bones
And the pain is tickling my soul
Mortals, mortals, mortals, mortals
Mortals, mortals, mortals, mortals
Mortals, mortals, mortals, mortals
